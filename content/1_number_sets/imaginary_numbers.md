# Imaginary Numbers

[Go back](./index.md)

Complex numbers can be divided into two major categories: **real numbers** and **imaginary numbers**. Since the smashing majority of most commonly used numbers are real numbers, let's define what imaginary numbers are so that we can proceed with real numbers later on.

First, let's agree that we can't take the square root of a negative number. That's because any number, negative or positive, when powered to 2 (squared) will result in a positive number, at least in a practical sense.

However, we can take the square root of a negative number **if we admit that the result is imaginary**:

* If the square root of 1 = 1
* We will say that the square root of -1 = *i* (lower case, italics)

*i* is the fundamental imaginary number! Observe:

$\sqrt{-4}$ = $\sqrt{4(-1)}$ = $\sqrt{4}$ * $\sqrt{-1}$ = 2 * *i* = 2*i*

$\sqrt{-4}$ = 2*i*
